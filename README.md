MovieBrain
========

MovieBrain, is a chrome extension that integrates your IMDb ratings to provide more customizable movie recommendations. If you have an IMDb account, your ratings will be imported and provided to the 'brain', which is the all-knowing recommender system powering this extension. You can get movie recommendations and more interestingly, you can fine-tune specific settings of the recommendation process to improve the quality of your movie recommendation list. This is a proof of concept of the PhD research by [Simon Dooms](http://twitter.com/sidooms) (Ghent University, Belgium). 


The MovieBrain extension is available [in the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moviebrain/egeaceljjpjhbgikdgodhaanoecbleln). Also check out the [themoviebrain.com](http://www.themoviebrain.com) website!
